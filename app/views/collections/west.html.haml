                  The antics and entertaining statements of Mr. Kanye West now seem almost orthodox to todays pop-culture. No one will deny his success throughout his career as a rap artist, but he seems to find it very easy to grab unwanted or negative attention from the media with his “speaking on impulse” issues. 
                  
                %p
                  Kanye Omari West was born on June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia but was raised up in Chicago, Illinois where he lived with his mother beginning at the age of three prior to his parents divorce. His mother was a teacher and his father was a famous photojournalist who was also an alleged member of the Black Panthers organization. Kanye would later go to college for fine art then transferring to english before finally dropping out of college to pursue a musical career. He moved to New York in early 2000 and started producing albums for artists like Jay-Z all the way to Ludacris. While being a producer, Kanye would continue to write his own demos and songs. He would then be offered a record deal at Roc-A-Fella Records and being his career as a recoding artist. 
                
                %p 
                  Kanye’s wrath of bad behavior has somehow been taboo in the recent years, and although he has received a lot of negative press for his actions, he still never seems to keep it quiet on his side. Mr. West wasn't nominated for being an asshole because of his fame or misuse of fame or even being a malicious human, he was nominated due the fact that every issue he finds himself in is from the lack of control that he has upon himself in his emotional state.

                    “Respect my trendsetting abilities. Once that happens, everyone wins.”        
                %p 
                  Mr. West might as well have a career change into UFC fighting seeing that he cant seem to stop from jumping on paparazzi. As much as we would all like to agree that the paparazzi profession is far from ethical, there is never an excuse for the consistent physical aggression that Mr. West has displayed upon his obsessive media hunters. In September of 2008, Kanye and his former manager were arrested for attacking a photojournalist at the LAX airport. Being charged with battery, grand theft and vandalism for damaging a photographers camera. He would then again be investigated in another assault case in 2013 in which would be settled by another civil settlement with the photographer. These are only some of the many ill-advised actions that Kanye has had with paparazzi.
                
                %p 
                  Kanye would also become great for live television, remember that wonderful meme that came from Mr. West interrupting Taylor Swifts thank you speech, of course you do. Kanye would later have a meltdown at the 2007 VMAs when he didn't win a trophy after his second time being nominated. Instead, he would continue to imply semi-racist remarks and hollering on to production crew in the backstage. A year before that he jumped on stage during the European 2006 MTV music awards ranting that if he didn't win the award, that the show would destroy its credibility, Kanye would later lose the nomination that night.

                
                  
                // Last Paragraph
                %p 
                  It’s quite possible that Kanye’s biggest “foot in mouth” moment came from the Katrina Red Cross Drive in which a very stunned Mike Myers had to stand on camera with Mr. West while he went on a good minute long rant about the presidents lack of action to the destruction in the south. At the end of his speech he spoke the famous “George Bush doesn't care about black people” before sending it over to a very uncomfortable Chris Tucker. The former president would later say that it was one of the lowest points during his time in office.
