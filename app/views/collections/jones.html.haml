                  Religion and Power

                %p
                  Religion and power have always seemed to mix poorly and there are plenty of dreadful events that have have occurred when the two find a firm grip. The rise of the infamous cult called the People’s Temple is one that shocked a nation into trying to understand the mind of a man by the name of Jim Jones. Jim Jones was a leader and creator of the Indiana cult called The People’s Temple and is solely responsible for the death of near to 1000 peoples lives.



                  
                %p
                  Coming from what is described as a harsh childhood, Jones was born into a family of a disabled war vet and a working mother. Jones became heavily influenced with the catholic religion at a very young age and was described as incredibly dedicated to the spread of the religion. Neighbors rumored that the family was a bit odd, Jones childhood playmates would have to sit during his mock services even at the age of 10. He would hold funeral services for animals that some believed that Jones would kill in order to hold the service. 



                .float_left.large-6.quote_container
                  %h2 
                    “To me death is not a fearful thing. It's living that's cursed.”
                %p 
                  He would be very successful during school and had a strong grasp on public speaking regardless of the lack of friends he had at his age. Many would find his over enthusiasm in religion a flaw and a turn off to his personality. He would often express his displeasing interest in normal boy activities and acted away from drinking and other “ill-advised” practices. 


                

                %p 
                  Jones would later marry a woman he meet threw working at a hospital and would adopt interracially and would promote the act of it. After trying to fill in for other pastors at various churches he would begin to build a small following. His following was much different from others in that he strongly opposed segregation, which at the time was a controversial issue, but would grant him a large following. His views on segregation however would create a negative stur in the catholic church and would eventually have him excommunicated from the church.


                .float_right.large-5
                  = image_tag "jones/jim3.jpg"
                

                  
                // Last Paragraph
                %p 
                  Jones then started promoting that he had the ability to have healing powers and that simply by his touch he could take away both mental and physical pain from his church gathering. Now with a following large enough to start a church but unable to receive the blessing and approval from the catholic church, Jones would have to be labeled as an outsider practice. He would pray upon the lost and homeless by establishing soup kitchens and encouraging a way for people to join his group. With a rise in followers, Jones now had the opportunity to mold what he had created into this “prefect utopian” society that he had in his head.


                %p
                  With the public eye shifting onto the group, Jones decided that it was time to leave Indiana in order to keep the secrecy of his group private enough to avoid unwanted detection. This was mostly due to the investigations involving his so called “healing” powers. A group of 60 or more families would head west to California to start what was called the new chapter in the groups history. 

                  
                %p
                  With the move came an expansion of his kingdom and a new mentality of unstable thoughts and actions that Jones had started to show. He started exercising his power differently towards his followers in a much more political manner and a communist sense. He started requiring his followers to forcefully donate precious belonging to him as a tribute to the cults success, some would even give away their homes, children and money to Jones.

                
                %p 
                  He showed examples of mild schizophrenia and paranoia by his lust for power, and would require his followers to start treating him as a god in their eyes. Jones would start taking drugs in large quantities for him to stay away longer during the night, many of drugs he was taking were most likely only worsening his pre-existing conditions of bi-polar symptoms and paranoia would then make Jones decide to move out of the states.

                %p 
                  The government and media were highly interested in what The People’s Temple was about. Journalist started trying to expose some questionable traits about the group and began releasing articles to the public about some of the rumored crazed control that Jones had on his followers. He relocated again to Guyana in South America where Jim Jones would hold his final grounds before his death.

                .float_left.large-5
                  = image_tag "jones/jim4.jpg"
                %p 
                  Rumors of the living conditions that Jones had set for his followers were getting very serious. By the stories it sounded as if Jones had his own slave encampment that worked as his own utopian setting. People received little food and would be given what were called “loyalty test” in which he would force followers to drink from his death cup which he said was poised and then after a few minutes after would say they were not going to die. These suicide drills would stir a lot of fear into the family back home who then begged for the United States government to become active. 

 
                %p 
                  With other governments getting involved Jones would threaten to commit a mass suicide if the group was not left alone. On November 19, 1978 the colony was visited by media crews and a dedicated congressman in order to unfold some of the horrible rumors coming from the south. When Jones told the crew to leave he then sent a group of gunman to the airfield where they killed five people to stop a “lie” article about the group.

                %p
                  As soon after the killing spree at the airfield occurred, Jones who now was completely lost decided to go forth in his plans of mass suicide. The commanded his entire following to drink the  cyanide-adulterated punch while Jones took his own life with a gun. When South American troops arrived the next day to find a death toll of a little over 900 people with 300 of them being children.
