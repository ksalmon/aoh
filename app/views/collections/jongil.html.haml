                  The Real Dr. Evil

                %p
                  The oppression that the people of North Korea have been faced with the past 50 years is no surprise when looking at who has been behind the wheel. Kim Jong-Il was the Dictator of North Korea from 1994 until his death in 2011 and will most likely go down in history as one of the most feared and power-hungry dictators that have come to power in the 20th century.



                  
                %p
                  Kim Jong-Il was the son of Kim Il-Sung who was founder of what is known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) and a Korean war commander during the second world war against Japan. Kim comes from a long line of political figures during the Japanese Imperialism in the 20th century.



                
                %p 
                  Kim’s birth location is somewhat of a mystery and was never cleared up after his death. There are two records, one from soviet Russia and another along the boarder of China. The fact is that a lot of the history of Kim has to be double checked by scholars due the insane amount of lies and rumors that are spread for some form of cover-up. Korean media stared describing Kim as a fearless leader the second he was beginning the preparations to take over as the supreme leader of the country.



                

                %p 
                  After his father’s death in 1994, Kim would take the Korean People’s Army and use it to maintain complete control of power in his time in office. What was once a democracy with an office was now a full blown communist state and Kim took all of the high power positions, merged it into one title and named himself above all rule. 


                .float_right.large-5
                  = image_tag "jongil/jongil3.jpg"
                

                  
                // Last Paragraph
                %p 
                  Kim would quickly turn North Korea into one of the most repressive government on earth.  Concentration camps started being built and filled with undesirables and political opponents in 1995 that would perform hard labor all the way to executions. These camps ran under a strict law of no right to free speech.


                %p
                  With facing accusation of crimes against humanity due to the creation and extending the 1990’s famine that almost nearly killed 20% of North Koreas total population. After the Soviet Union failed, all of its support to its countries would be cut short and would then create a huge crisis due to the lack of food in the country. Kim’s complete neglect to the situation only made things worse as the death toll rose to about 22 million people in four years. 


                  
                %p
                  The United States agreed to help North Korea with aid during 1997 in exchange the North Korean government would drop all efforts into researching nuclear warfare. Kim would agree to these terms and the US would start running aid trips, however only 2 years late Kim went back on his agreement and secretly started research back into weapons research. Korea has still yet to fully recover from the famine and still receives foreign aid.

                
                
                %p 
                  The most shocking allegations came from the 1980’s when Kim was involved with two separate acts of terrorism funded on a state level to take out political opponents. Both were bombings that killed almost 150 people combined. After the events Kim would later threaten his own country and say that punishments will be delivered if anyone questioned him.
