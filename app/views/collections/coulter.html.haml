                  What Ann Coulter has been doing with journalism can be seen as a lack of responsibility and compassion, some would even call this a form of trolling.  She still has a loyal fan base, even after insulting and making insensitive remarks about topics and groups that she has shown us that she knows nothing about is a crime all in itself.  The media may or may not be just as important as government itself. It has the ability to sway the public on current topics with fallacies and glorify things that shouldn't be gloried only because of a certain political weight that it may hold. Unfortunately in America, the media has destroyed what most people can only describe as factual news. It’s agenda is now more about either scaring the public or gaining points on the ratings. Ms Coulter has taken these to all new lows by displaying a show of complete and utter misunderstanding and extreme views that she has upon the world that she lives in. 


                  
                %p
                  Ann Coulter was Born in New York City on December 8, 1961 and would later move outside the city into the Connecticut boarder where her family would be raised. She would later attend Cornell in upstate New York where she would sink her teeth into the profession of journalism by helping found the Cornell Review. She would graduate with a B.A in history and would immediately go to law school in Michigan.

                    "We should invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity." 
                %p 
                  Coulter would find progress in the judicial system as a lawyer which she specialized in corporate law. Is was said that she almost took a path for running for congress on the Libertarian ticket right before 2000, but would later be seen as a empty seat only to give it a opposing democratic candidate. Instead, she dove into the mess that is political analyzing. Now as a commentator, her career would be launched by the people at MSNBC as a legal correspondent, which she would later be fired from (twice) after insulting the former U.S. ambassador of France and then again for getting into a way heated battle against a group of Vietnam vets who were campaigning agains making land mines illegal for use in war due to its outstanding negative effects it has on the locals.


                

                %p 
                  Ann Coulter seemed like she would just say anything to get people to cringe, which is why at first she was looked at as a joke to most reporters. She would be persistent in publishing books about her ideals and views ranging about topics on the impeachment of Bill Clinton as president to media bias and terrorism. Of the current books that she would put out, 7 would get enough press to be put on the New York Times Best Seller List.

                %p 
                  If Coulter didn't have a book about one of her many opinions, then she probably wrote a column on it. Due to Coulters large fan base, online editors find her to be marketing gold regardless of what she's printing. It was until the attacks on September 11 when editors asked her to reword some ideas and then would be fired from the NRO because of her “lack of professionalism, friendship, and loyalty” as said by one of the editors. 

                %p
                  Fox news would later adopt her into the league of a conservative columnist would would grant her almost full power over what she was able to get away with on TV. She was granted a weekly update on shows like Bill O’Reilly where the two would sit and talk in circle about various topics. 

                  
                %p
                  She would attack 9/11 widows after a few would take opposing political ties towards John Edwards who she called a “faggot”. She would write that "I've never seen people enjoying their husbands' deaths so much… how do we know their husbands weren't planning to divorce these harpies? Now that their shelf life is dwindling, they'd better hurry up and appear in Playboy.”. This would most likely been seen as the worst moment in Coulters history as an political analyst.

                    "We just want Jews to be perfected, as they say."
                
                %p 
                  Thankfully, the world is starting to understand that the hate and intolerance that Ms Coulter has shown to the people of the US is nothing more then intolerable. In 2014 in attempts to add relevance to her slightly dying career, she decided to become a crib towards a campaign on freeing some kidnapped school children in Nigeria. Michelle Obama, who was backing the plug would post a picture to social media with her holding a sign with the hashtag “BringBackOurGirls” on the front. Coulter in all her wisdom would make a parody picture instead saying “BringBackOurCountry”. Her stunt was completely transparent as its hateful demeanor and she would be mocked publicly all over the internet for the next two weeks.
